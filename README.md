Explaining and showcasing all 10 design patterns with real time Xamarin Examples.

## Singleton Design Pattern 
1. Basically we can implement the singleton pattern by ensuring whether a class has only one instance. 
2. This can be done by making the constructor private so that no one can create an object of the singleton class. 
3. Then declare a private variable of class type and initialize it at class scope.
4. Use locking mechanism to avoid deadlock during multi threading action.
